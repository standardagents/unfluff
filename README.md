# Unfluff

> **Early preview** — this extension is under active development. Expect rough edges.

**Cut through LinkedIn noise.** Unfluff is a Chrome extension that uses AI to summarize and categorize LinkedIn feed posts so you can focus on what actually matters.

## How it works

Unfluff replaces the LinkedIn feed with a clean, minimalist reading experience. It analyzes each post and adds:

- A short plain-English summary
- A category tag (e.g. "hiring", "self-promo", "insight", "engagement bait")
- Visual indicators so you can skim your feed in seconds

No clutter, no sidebar noise, no suggested content — just the posts, distilled.

## Install

This extension is currently in early preview. To install it as an unpacked Chrome extension:
